# About
For our senior capstone project, we tried to recreate “Barry Has a Secret”, a self described intense food-hiding simulation game. The game is a short first-person 3D puzzle game that can be played in a browser. The objective is to hide miscellaneous body parts in various cabinets and drawers before the police arrive to inspect the room. The player has 90 seconds to pick up pieces and stow them away. If a cop notices a body part, they become suspicious and the player moves on to the next day. If the cop notices two or more body parts, the player is caught and the game ends. There are three total days with an increasing amount of parts to hide each day. In our recreation, the player plays as Dr. Bixler who must hide terrapin turtles before Dr. Wnek searches for his terrapins. For our twist on the game, we planned to add different types of physics to each level. We did not realize how difficult this would be and instead chose to include randomized spawn locations so the game would have better replay value.

# Acknowledgements
We would like to thank Dr. Bixler, our esteemed computer science teacher. Throughout our journey in computer science, Dr. Bixler has been an invaluable source of knowledge, inspiration, and guidance. His passion for the subject and dedication to teaching at the Marine Academy of Technology and Environmental Science has had a profound impact on our learning experience. We would also like to acknowledge Jon Gery for his assistance in installing the required software on our school computers to make this game a reality. Both of their contributions have led us down the path of success, and for that, we show sincere gratitude. Lastly, we would like to recognize the developers at Sandbay Games who developed "Barry Has a Secret". Their game was a big inspiration for our project.
